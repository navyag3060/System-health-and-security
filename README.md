# System-health-and-security

I have developed a comprehensive Linux monitoring tool that combines real-time system resource monitoring with network activity detection to enhance security and performance insights. 🎯
🔑 Key Features:

1️⃣ System Resource Monitoring:

    Tracks CPU, memory, and disk usage in real-time.
    Provides periodic updates with user-friendly, color-coded outputs.

2️⃣ Network Activity Monitoring:

    Monitors websites being accessed in real-time.
    Detects suspicious URLs using predefined keywords and sends email alerts for potential threats.
    💡 Why This Matters:

With growing concerns around system performance and cybersecurity, our tool offers a lightweight, easy-to-use solution that caters to:

    Home Users: Monitor system health and ensure safe browsing.
    Small Businesses: Identify and mitigate risky web activity.
    Students & Educators: Learn about Linux scripting, resource monitoring, and network security.

🛠️ Technologies Used:

    Bash scripting for automation.
    Tools like tcpdump, mailutils, top, free, and df for resource and traffic monitoring.
    Custom logic to identify and respond to potential threats in real-time.

🎯 Impact:

This project demonstrates how open-source tools and Linux expertise can be leveraged to solve practical problems while fostering learning in cybersecurity and system management.
